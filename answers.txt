1. What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
A: Gitignore is a text file placed in the git repository which makes sure that git does not track these files because user does not want it to be uploaded to the master reposiitory. For Java Project, it should include:
# NetBeans specific #
nbproject/private/
build/
nbbuild/
dist/
nbdist/
nbactions.xml
nb-configuration.xml

# Class Files #
*.class

# Package Files #
*.jar
*.war
*.ear

2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A: Fast-forward in git means when we want to merge a branch then git will push it to the one just checked-out. It will simply shift the master HEAD.

3. Why should you have different branches?
A: Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A: You can have as many remotes as you want, but you can only have one remote named "origin".
